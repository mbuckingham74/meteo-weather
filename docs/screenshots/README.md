## Screenshot Best Practices

### Resolution & Size
- **Minimum resolution:** 1920x1080 (Full HD)
- **Recommended resolution:** 2560x1440 (2K) for better quality on Retina displays
- **Format:** PNG (best quality) or JPG (smaller file size)
- **Compression:** Use light compression to keep file size under 500KB per image

### Browser Setup
- **Clear cache** before taking screenshots
- **Use incognito/private mode** to avoid extensions interfering
- **Zoom level:** 100% (default)
- **Browser:** Chrome or Firefox for consistency
- **Window size:** Maximize or use 1920x1080 fixed size

### Content Preparation
1. **Select interesting data:** Choose cities with varied weather patterns
2. **Use realistic examples:** Actual weather data, not test scenarios
3. **Show populated UI:** Forms filled in, charts with data, etc.
4. **Clean state:** No error messages or loading states (unless demonstrating those features)
5. **Test data:** Ensure API keys are working and data is loading properly

### Tools Recommended
- **macOS:**
  - Screenshot app (Cmd+Shift+5)
  - CleanShot X (premium option)
- **Windows:**
  - Snipping Tool
  - ShareX (free)
- **Linux:**
  - Flameshot (free)
  - Shutter
- **Cross-platform:**
  - Browser DevTools (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P → "Capture screenshot")

### Editing Tips
- **Crop carefully:** Remove browser chrome, bookmarks bar, OS taskbar
- **Annotate (optional):** Use arrows or highlights to draw attention to key features
- **Consistent style:** Use same color scheme for annotations across all screenshots
- **Privacy check:** Ensure no personal information (email addresses, names) is visible

```

Replace placeholders with real screenshots as soon as possible for best presentation.
