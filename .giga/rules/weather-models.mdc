# weather-models

Core Weather Data Models:

1. Historical Weather Records
- Maintains historical weather data with 10-year lookback period
- Climate normals calculation with weighted averaging
- Statistical analysis of temperature distributions and patterns
- Links historical precipitation data to climate trends
Importance: 95/100

2. Location Weather Profile
- Geocoded location data with weather station mapping
- Current conditions with extended forecast integration
- Historical climate pattern associations
- UV, air quality and weather alert aggregation
Importance: 90/100

3. Temperature Probability Model
- Statistical temperature distribution analysis
- Historical temperature band calculations
- Record temperature tracking and comparison
- Temperature probability forecasting
Importance: 85/100

4. Precipitation Analytics Model
- Historical rain pattern analysis
- Precipitation intensity normalization
- Storm tracking and movement prediction
- Multi-year rainfall comparisons
Importance: 80/100

5. Climate Pattern Detection
- Long-term climate trend analysis
- Temperature and precipitation pattern matching
- Climate zone classification
- Seasonal variation tracking
Importance: 85/100

Key Relationships:
- Location -> Weather Station -> Historical Records
- Current Conditions -> Historical Normals -> Probability Models
- Temperature Data -> Climate Patterns -> Weather Alerts
- Precipitation Data -> Storm Tracking -> Radar Integration

The models support:
- Multi-location climate comparison
- AI-powered weather analysis
- Historical pattern recognition
- Predictive weather modeling
- Climate zone matching
