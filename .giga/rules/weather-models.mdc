Core Data Models:

1. Location Climate Model
Path: frontend/src/components/location/LocationComparisonView/locationData.js
- Climate characteristics scoring matrix
- Temperature bands with weighted importance
- Humidity preference ranges
- Precipitation pattern classifications
Importance Score: 85

2. Weather Pattern Model 
Path: frontend/src/components/weather/WeatherDashboard/TodaysHighlights.jsx
- Weather condition categorization schema
- Dew point calculation mapping
- Weather metric priority weights
- Condition-to-icon mapping rules
Importance Score: 75

3. Temperature Distribution Model
Path: frontend/src/components/charts/TemperatureProbabilityChart.jsx
- Temperature band classifications
- Probability density mappings
- Percentile calculation rules
- Temperature trend categorization
Importance Score: 80

4. Historical Precipitation Model
Path: frontend/src/components/weather/HistoricalRainTable.jsx
- Precipitation pattern classification
- Rain day percentage thresholds
- Weather condition correlations
- Precipitation intensity scales
Importance Score: 75

5. Climate Preference Model
Path: frontend/src/components/location/LocationComparisonView/AILocationFinder.jsx
- Natural language preference mapping
- Quantifiable climate criteria translations
- Current location baseline metrics
- Relative comparison weights
Importance Score: 90

Key Relationships:
- Location models maintain climate scoring matrices
- Weather patterns link to condition categories
- Temperature distributions connect to preference models
- Historical data maps to pattern classifications
- User preferences correlate with climate metrics
