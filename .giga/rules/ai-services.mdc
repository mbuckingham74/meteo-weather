## Core AI Service Components

### Location Finder Service (85/100)
Path: frontend/src/components/location/LocationComparisonView/AILocationFinder.jsx
- Natural language processing for climate preference interpretation
- Translation of qualitative preferences into quantifiable climate criteria
- Integration with current location baseline for relative comparisons
- Smart scoring algorithm for location matching based on climate preferences

### Weather Analysis System (90/100)
Path: frontend/src/components/weather/WeatherDashboard/AIWeatherAnalyzer.jsx
- Multi-location weather pattern analysis
- Historical climate data comparison engine
- Intelligent aggregation of weather metrics across time ranges
- Cross-location climate similarity detection

### Natural Language Query Processor (80/100)
Path: frontend/src/components/location/LocationConfirmationModal.jsx
- Structured query parsing for weather-related questions
- Context-aware response generation
- Multi-factor location validation with confidence scoring
- VPN/proxy detection for location reliability assessment

### Climate Preference Engine (75/100)
Path: frontend/src/utils/aiLocationFinder.js
- Conversion of natural language preferences to climate metrics
- Weighted scoring system for temperature, humidity, and precipitation
- Location database integration with climate characteristics
- Smart suggestion engine using current location baseline

Key Business Rules:
1. Location matching must consider historical climate patterns
2. Weather analysis requires minimum 7-day to maximum 5-year data range
3. Natural language queries must be validated against known weather patterns
4. Climate preferences require both qualitative and quantitative analysis
