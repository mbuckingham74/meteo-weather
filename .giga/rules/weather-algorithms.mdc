# weather-algorithms

The weather algorithms system implements specialized meteorological analysis and processing capabilities across several key areas:

## Climate Analysis Engine
`backend/services/climateService.js`
- Temperature probability distribution calculations using multi-year historical data
- Record temperature identification and trend analysis 
- Climate normals computation with configurable baseline periods
- Seasonal pattern detection and anomaly identification
Importance Score: 90/100

## Historical Comparison System
`backend/services/historicalDataService.js`
- Multi-year pattern recognition for temperature and precipitation
- Percentile-based temperature band calculations
- Statistical aggregation of historical weather events
- Trend analysis across different time scales (daily/monthly/yearly)
Importance Score: 85/100

## Radar Processing Pipeline
`frontend/src/services/radarService.js`
- Frame-based weather radar data management
- Storm tracking calculations including direction and speed
- Multiple data source integration (RainViewer/OpenWeather)
- Historical frame playback with animation controls
Importance Score: 80/100

## Temperature Distribution Analysis
`frontend/src/components/charts/TemperatureProbabilityChart.jsx`
- Statistical temperature distribution modeling
- Percentile-based temperature range analysis
- Climate normal deviation calculations
- Confidence interval computation for forecasts
Importance Score: 75/100

## Weather Pattern Recognition
`frontend/src/utils/weatherHelpers.js`
- Custom weather condition classification algorithms
- Temperature band calculations for different climate zones
- Precipitation pattern analysis and categorization
- Weather metric normalization and unit conversion
Importance Score: 70/100
