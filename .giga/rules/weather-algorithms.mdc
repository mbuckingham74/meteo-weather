Core Weather Pattern Analysis Components:

1. Temperature Distribution Analysis
Path: frontend/src/components/charts/TemperatureProbabilityChart.jsx
- Gaussian mixture modeling for temperature ranges
- Multi-modal distribution fitting for seasonal patterns 
- Percentile-based threshold detection
- Historical temperature normalization
Importance Score: 85/100

2. Climate Pattern Detection
Path: backend/services/climateService.js
- Statistical clustering for weather sequence identification
- Pattern matching across 3-7 day windows
- Named pattern classification (e.g. "June Gloom")
- Historical frequency calculation
- Seasonal pattern weighting
Importance Score: 90/100

3. Weather Twin Algorithm 
Path: backend/services/aiLocationFinderService.js
- Location similarity scoring using:
  - Temperature delta matching (±5°F)
  - Precipitation pattern alignment
  - Humidity correlation
  - Cloud cover matching
- Pre-computed location clusters
- Hourly similarity updates
Importance Score: 85/100

4. Radar Data Processing
Path: frontend/src/components/weather/RadarMap.jsx
- Storm tracking simulation
- Precipitation intensity calculations
- Multi-layer weather visualization
- Alert geographic positioning
Importance Score: 80/100

5. Historical Analysis Engine
Path: backend/scripts/bulkHistoricalImport.js
- Climate normals computation 
- Temperature record identification
- Pattern anomaly detection using z-scores
- Multi-year trend analysis
Importance Score: 75/100

Core Domain Rules:
1. Weather pattern classification requires minimum 3-day sequences
2. Temperature matching uses ±5°F tolerance
3. Location similarity requires 70% pattern match across all factors
4. Anomaly detection requires 2+ standard deviation threshold
5. Historical comparisons use 30-year baseline periods
