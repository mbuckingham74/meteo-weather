## Core Data Flow Patterns

### Weather Data Aggregation Flow
- Multi-source weather data integration via LocationComparisonView
- Historical data normalized through Climate Data Aggregation system
- Hybrid local/cloud sync for user favorites with conflict resolution
- Multi-timeframe data comparison (7 days to 5 years)
- Weather pattern matching across different locations

### Caching Strategy 
- Weather data uses stale-while-revalidate with 15-minute TTL
- Location data cached with accuracy tier classification
- Historical patterns cached with seasonal considerations
- Smart deduplication for favorite locations
- Background sync specific to weather updates

### State Management Architecture
- Location state synchronized with URL parameters
- Climate preferences persisted across sessions
- Multi-point comparison state (up to 4 locations)
- Weather alert severity classification state
- Historical trend analysis state

### Data Transformation Pipeline
- Temperature delta matching calculations
- Humidity pattern alignment processing
- Precipitation preference analysis
- Seasonal pattern normalization
- Climate similarity scoring computations
