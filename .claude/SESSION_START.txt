Hi Claude! Quick context for this session:

PROJECT: Meteo Weather App (Weather Spark clone)
- React frontend, Node/Express backend, MySQL, Docker
- Read CLAUDE.md for full context before doing anything

WORKFLOW (NEVER SKIP):
1. Code locally → Commit → Push to GitHub
2. STOP AND WAIT - don't deploy automatically
3. I test localhost first
4. I explicitly say "deploy" when ready
5. Only then deploy to beta

KEY DIFFERENCES:
- Localhost = Dockerfile.dev (webpack-dev-server, port 3000)
- Beta = Dockerfile (nginx production build)
- They look different sometimes - always test localhost first

RULES:
- Use TodoWrite for multi-step tasks
- Update CHANGELOG.md for user-facing changes
- Check docs/DEPLOYMENT_TESTING_CHECKLIST.md before deploying
- Never deploy without my explicit "deploy" command
- Check browser console (F12) before troubleshooting CSS

SERVER ACCESS:
- Beta: https://meteo-beta.tachyonfuture.com
- SSH: ssh michael@tachyonfuture.com (ask before connecting)
- Deploy: bash scripts/deploy-beta.sh (on server only)

NOW: [Tell me what you want to work on]
