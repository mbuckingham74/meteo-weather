/**
 * Weather Dashboard - Re-export from refactored component structure
 *
 * REFACTORED (Nov 2025): Split 1,250-line monolith into focused sub-components:
 * - WeatherDashboard/WeatherDashboard.jsx (main component, ~350 lines)
 * - WeatherDashboard/CurrentConditionsSection.jsx (~120 lines)
 * - WeatherDashboard/TodaysHighlights.jsx (~280 lines)
 * - WeatherDashboard/QuickActionsPanel.jsx (~280 lines)
 * - WeatherDashboard/ChartsGrid.jsx (~180 lines)
 *
 * This maintains backward compatibility with existing imports.
